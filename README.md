# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This project required transforming our original Portfolio project using the Bootstrap library to stylize our HTML instead of customized CSS.

## Getting Started

Using Bootstrap required understanding the row and column grid system that is unique to Bootstrap as well as learning how to copy, paste, and manipulate snippets of code into our HTML skeleton.
